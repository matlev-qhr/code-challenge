/**
 * A Chess King stands on his board and wants to know how long it will
 * take him to walk to each square from his starting position.  Walls have
 * started to appear in his kingdom and can potentially make it impossible
 * for the king to reach a square.
 *
 * Given a SQUARE, one-dimensional array representing the King's board,
 * calculate the minimum steps it will take for the king to reach each
 * square from his STARTING position.  Like in the game of chess, the King
 * may move in any direction (forwards, backwards, diagonally,
 * orthogonally).  The king may only move one square at a time.
 *
 * preset values:
 *   127 = King start position
 *    -1 = A wall, the king cannot move through these
 *     0 = Unvisited location
 *
 * Example:
 *   input: {0, 0, W, 0,
 *           K, 0, W, W,
 *           0, W, 0, 0,
 *           0, W, 0, 0}
 *  output: {1, 1, W, 0,
 *           K, 1, W, W,
 *           1, W, 2, 3,
 *           2, W, 3, 3}
 *
 * @param input
