    /**
     * The Fibonacci sequence is a will known sequence defined by the equation
     * F? = F??? + F??? where F? = 0 and F? = 1.
     * This results in a sequence that begins as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
     * and continues on forever.
     *
     * It follows that every positive, natural number can be composed by adding
     * unique combinations of Fibonacci numbers.  ex:
     * 8 = 5 + 3; 5 + 2 + 1;
     * 12 = 8 + 3 + 1
     * 29 = 21 + 8; 21 + 5 + 3; 21 + 5 + 2 + 1; ...;
     *
     * The OPTIMUM composition of an integer X is one that has the fewest
     * Fibonacci numbers used.  The Optimal number (P?) represents the minimum
     * numbers required to sum to X. ex:
     * P of 8 = 2
     * P of 12 = 3
     * P of 29 = 2
     *
     * Find the count of all numbers between 1 and 1-million inclusive that have
     * a P value of 4 or more.
     *
     * This should optimize SPACE and TIME.
     *
